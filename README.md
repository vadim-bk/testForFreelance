- Edit a user from the list
- Delete a user from the list

### Other requirements:

- Use fake API functions from /api to simulate async requests

- All UI and styling up to you. You can use some UI library, but we would like to see your own CSS code too(prefer Styled Components)
- Make improvements that will provide the best UI/UX solution
- Create a new repo on git and push your work

### Bonus tasks:

- Add unit tests
- Add some new functionality at your discretion

### Please answer these questions at the end of your test work:

- How much time does this work take for you?
- What would you like to improve if you have additional time?
